# GSRP-Gradient-Stable-Representative-Pruning
We propose GSRP, a two-stage one-shot pruning method for noisy training. It first removes redundant filters through activation clustering, then selects stable weights using cross-batch gradient consistency and magnitude. On CIFAR-10N, and CIFAR-100N, GSRP outperforms existing pruning baselines at high sparsity.
